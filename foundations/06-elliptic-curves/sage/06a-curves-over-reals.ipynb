    "**Motivating Question.** In Modules 01 and 05 we built cryptography on the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}^*$. That group works, but it has a weakness: sub-exponential attacks (index calculus) mean we need 2048-bit primes for adequate security. Is there a *different* group where the discrete log is even harder, so we can use shorter keys? The answer is **yes**, elliptic curves provide groups where the best known attacks are fully exponential, enabling 256-bit keys with security comparable to 3072-bit RSA.\n",
