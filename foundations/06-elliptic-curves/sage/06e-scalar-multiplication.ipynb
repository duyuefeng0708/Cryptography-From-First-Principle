    "**Motivating Question.** To use elliptic curves for cryptography, we need to compute $kP$ (adding $P$ to itself $k$ times) for *very large* $k$, say $k \\approx 2^{256}$. Adding $P$ one step at a time would take $2^{256}$ operations, which is impossibly slow. Is there a shortcut? Yes: the **double-and-add** algorithm computes $kP$ in only $O(\\log k)$ steps, just as square-and-multiply computes $g^k$ efficiently in $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}^*$.\n",
