This exponent is the **discrete logarithm**, and finding it is the hard problem that secures Diffie-Hellman and related schemes.\n- If the group is not cyclic, there's no single generator, so you can't set up a clean DLP. The algebraic structure is messier and harder to build protocols on.\n\nThat's why $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}^*, \\times)$ for prime $p$ is the classic choice: it's always cyclic (a theorem we'll take on faith for now). Elliptic curve groups used in practice are also cyclic.\n\n> **Key fact.** $(\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}^*, \\times)$ is cyclic if and only if $n = 1, 2, 4, p^k$, or $2p^k$ for an odd prime $p$.

All of $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}^*, \\times)$ are cyclic. |\n| **Non-cyclic** | Some groups (like $(\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z}^*)$) have no generator at all |\n| **Generator count** | Exactly $\\varphi(|G|)$ generators exist in a cyclic group |\n| **DLP** | Finding $k$ from $g^k$ is the discrete logarithm problem, computationally hard for large groups |\n\n**The punchline:** a cyclic group can be \"unrolled\" from a single generator. Every element gets a unique exponent \"address.\" Computing addresses is easy (multiply), but reversing them is hard (discrete log). That asymmetry is the foundation of Diffie-Hellman, ElGamal, and DSA.\n\n**Next:** [Subgroups and Lagrange's Theorem](01e-subgroups-lagrange.ipynb). Non-generators create smaller groups *inside* the big one, and their sizes are brutally constrained by divisibility."
