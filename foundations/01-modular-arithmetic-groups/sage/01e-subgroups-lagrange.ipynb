   "source": "## Why This Matters for Cryptography\n\nLagrange's theorem explains why cryptographers care about **safe primes**.\n\nIf $p$ is prime, $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}^*)$ has order $p - 1$. The subgroup sizes are the divisors of $p - 1$. If $p - 1$ has lots of small factors, there are lots of small subgroups, and an attacker can exploit them.\n\n### The Pohlig-Hellman idea\n\nSuppose you need to solve $g^x = h$ in a group of order $n = p - 1$. If $n$ has a small factor $d$, here is the trick:\n\n1. Raise both sides to the power $n/d$: compute $g' = g^{n/d}$ and $h' = h^{n/d}$.\n2. Both $g'$ and $h'$ now live in a **subgroup of size $d$** (Lagrange guarantees this, since $(g')^d = g^n = 1$).\n3. Solve the DLP in this tiny subgroup by brute force: find $x'$ with $(g')^{x'} = h'$.\n4. This gives you $x \\bmod d$, one piece of the secret.\n\nRepeat for each small factor of $n$, then combine with the Chinese Remainder Theorem (Module 04). If $n$ has many small factors, you solve several tiny DLPs instead of one massive one.\n\nA **safe prime** $p = 2q + 1$ (where $q$ is also prime) blocks this: $p - 1 = 2q$ has no small factors beyond 2, so there are no useful small subgroups to exploit."
