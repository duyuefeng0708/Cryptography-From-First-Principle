    "\n",
    "**Reed-Solomon codes** (1960) are one of the most widely deployed error-correcting codes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **QR codes**: the black-and-white squares on everything from boarding passes to restaurant menus\n",
    "- **CDs and DVDs**: withstand scratches by encoding data with redundancy\n",
    "- **Deep-space communication**: NASA's Voyager probes use Reed-Solomon to transmit data across billions of miles\n",
    "- **Blockchain**: data availability sampling in Ethereum uses Reed-Solomon\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is surprisingly simple: **encode a message as a polynomial, evaluate it at\n",
    "extra points for redundancy, and use Lagrange interpolation to recover the original\n",
    "polynomial even if some evaluations are lost or corrupted.**\n",
