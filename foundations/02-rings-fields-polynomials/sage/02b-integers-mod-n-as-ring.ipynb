    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explored **Z/nZ as a commutative ring**. Key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Z/nZ is a ring** with addition and multiplication mod n. The distributive law connects the two operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Zero divisors** are nonzero elements $a$ with $ab = 0$ for some nonzero $b$. In Z/nZ, $a$ is a zero divisor iff $\\gcd(a, n) > 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Units** are elements with multiplicative inverses. In Z/nZ, $a$ is a unit iff $\\gcd(a, n) = 1$. The units form the group (Z/nZ)\\* that you studied in Module 01.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dichotomy**: Every nonzero element of Z/nZ is either a unit or a zero divisor, never both, never neither.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Z/nZ has no zero divisors iff n is prime**, and in that case, Z/pZ is a **field** (every nonzero element is a unit). We will study fields in notebook 02d.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Crypto implication**: Zero divisors destroy information (multiplication is not injective). Cryptosystems need units or fields. This is why RSA uses the unit group (Z/nZ)\\*, and why ECC works over prime fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we learned here will be essential for:**\n",
    "- Notebook 02d: defining fields precisely (a ring where every nonzero element is a unit)\n",
    "- Module 03: constructing extension fields GF(2^8) for AES\n",
