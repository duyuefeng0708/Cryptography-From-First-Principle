    "- **Irreducible = field:** The quotient is a field if and only if the modulus polynomial is irreducible. Reducible modulus gives zero divisors, just like composite modulus in $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
    "- **The general pattern:** $\\text{GF}(p^n) = \\mathbb{F}_p[x]/(\\text{irreducible of degree } n)$.\n",
