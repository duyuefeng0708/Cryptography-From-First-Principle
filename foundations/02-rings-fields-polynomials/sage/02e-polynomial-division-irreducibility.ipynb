SageMath: `f.quo_rem(g)`, `f // g`, `f % g` |\n| **Irreducible polynomials** | The polynomial analogue of prime numbers. They cannot be factored into lower-degree polynomials, and they build all polynomials via unique factorization |\n| **Irreducibility depends on the field** | The same polynomial can be irreducible over one field and reducible over another. Always specify the field! |\n| **No-roots test (degree 2 and 3 only)** | For degree $\\ge 4$, a polynomial can have no roots yet still be reducible, factoring into two quadratics for example |\n| **Counting irreducibles** | There are approximately $p^n / n$ monic irreducible polynomials of degree $n$ over $\\mathbb{F}_p$, and at least one always exists. This guarantees we can always construct $\\mathrm{GF}(p^n)$ |\n| **Crypto connection** | AES uses the irreducible $x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ to build $\\mathrm{GF}(2^8)$, the field where all byte-level AES operations live |\n\n**Next:** [Quotient Rings and Field Extensions](02f-quotient-rings.ipynb), where we use irreducible polynomials to *actually construct* new fields."
