Equivalently, a field has no zero divisors |\n| **$\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is a field iff $n$ is prime** | When $n$ is prime, $\\gcd(a, n) = 1$ for all $0 < a < n$, so every nonzero element is invertible |\n| **Familiar fields and non-fields** | $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathbb{C}$, and $\\mathbb{F}_p$ are fields. $\\mathbb{Z}$ (no integer inverse for 2) and $\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (zero divisors) are not |\n| **$\\text{GF}(2)$, the smallest field** | Just $\\{0, 1\\}$, where addition is XOR and multiplication is AND |\n| **Crypto needs fields** | Protocols require division (multiplication by inverse) for every nonzero element. Elliptic curves, AES, and secret sharing all rely on field arithmetic |\n\n**Looking ahead:** We've seen that $\\mathbb{F}_p$ gives us one field for each prime $p$. But AES uses a field with $2^8 = 256$ elements, and 256 is not prime! How can that be a field? The answer involves **polynomial quotient rings**, which we'll explore starting in the next notebook.\n\n**Next:** [Polynomial Division and Irreducibility](02e-polynomial-division-irreducibility.ipynb)"
