    "- A **ring** is a set with two operations ($+$ and $\\times$) satisfying ten axioms\n",
    "- $(R, +)$ must be an **abelian group**; $(R, \\times)$ must be a **monoid** (associative with identity)\n",
    "- The **distributive law** $a(b+c) = ab + ac$ is the crucial axiom, it is the only axiom that involves *both* operations, and it is what makes the two operations into a coherent system\n",
    "- The integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ and the modular integers $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ are both rings\n",
    "- The natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ are NOT a ring (no additive inverses)\n",
    "- A ring does **not** require multiplicative inverses or commutativity of $\\times$\n",

    "> **Crypto foreshadowing:** AES (the Advanced Encryption Standard) performs all of its operations inside the ring $\\text{GF}(2)[x] / (x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)$, a quotient of a polynomial ring. In Module 02f, you will build this ring yourself. The distributive law is what makes AES's MixColumns operation work correctly.\n",
