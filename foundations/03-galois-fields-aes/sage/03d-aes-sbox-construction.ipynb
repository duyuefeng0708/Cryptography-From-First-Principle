   "source": "## Summary\n\n| Concept | Key idea |\n|---------|----------|\n| **S-box construction** | GF(256) multiplicative inverse followed by an affine transformation over GF(2) |\n| **Inverse provides nonlinearity** | The field inverse achieves near-optimal nonlinearity (112/120), resisting linear and differential attacks |\n| **Affine map breaks algebraic structure** | Without it, the pure inverse satisfies exploitable algebraic equations. The affine step disrupts these relations |\n| **No fixed points** | $S(b) \\neq b$ and $S(b) \\neq \\bar{b}$ for all $b$, thanks to the specific choice of matrix $A$ and constant $c = \\texttt{0x63}$ |\n| **Bijection** | The S-box is a permutation of all 256 bytes, essential for AES decryption to work |\n| **Inverse S-box** | Uses $A^{-1}$ to undo the affine step, then takes the GF(256) inverse again |\n\n> **Crypto foreshadowing:** The S-box is SubBytes, just one of four AES round operations. In notebook 03e, we'll see MixColumns, which uses *matrix multiplication* over GF(256). The interplay between SubBytes (nonlinear, byte-level) and MixColumns (linear, column-level) is what makes AES secure.\n\n**Next:** [AES MixColumns as Field Ops](03e-aes-mixcolumns-as-field-ops.ipynb), matrix multiplication over GF(256)."
