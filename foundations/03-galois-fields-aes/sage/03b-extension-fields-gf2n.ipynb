   "source": "## Summary\n\n| Concept | Key idea |\n|---------|----------|\n| **GF(2)$[x]$ is not a field** | Polynomials of degree $\\geq 1$ have no multiplicative inverse in the polynomial ring |\n| **Irreducible polynomials** | The polynomial analogue of primes. Quotienting by one of degree $n$ produces GF($2^n$), a field with $2^n$ elements |\n| **Reducible polynomials fail** | Using a reducible polynomial creates zero divisors, not a field |\n| **Addition = XOR** | Adding polynomials in GF($2^n$) is just XOR of coefficient bit-strings, no reduction needed |\n| **Multiplication needs reduction** | Multiply the polynomials, then reduce mod $p(x)$ to keep the degree below $n$ |\n| **Isomorphic fields** | Different irreducible polynomials of the same degree give isomorphic fields. The choice affects implementation, not algebra |\n\n> **Crypto foreshadowing:** AES uses GF($2^8$) = GF(2)$[x]\\,/\\,(x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)$. In notebook 03c, we build this exact field and do byte-level arithmetic inside it. The S-box, MixColumns, and key schedule all live here.\n\n**Next:** [GF(256) Arithmetic](03c-gf256-arithmetic.ipynb), the specific field that powers AES."
