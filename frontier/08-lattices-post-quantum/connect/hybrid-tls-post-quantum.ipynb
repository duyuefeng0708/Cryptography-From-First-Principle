    "\n",
    "1. **X25519** (classical ECDH on Curve25519, from Module 06):\n",
    "   - Client sends an X25519 public key share\n",
    "   - Server responds with its X25519 public key share\n",
    "   - Both derive a 32-byte shared secret $K_{\\text{classical}}$\n",

    "2. **ML-KEM-768** (post-quantum, from this module):\n",
    "   - Client sends an ML-KEM encapsulation key (public key)\n",
    "   - Server encapsulates a shared secret and sends the ciphertext\n",
    "   - Client decapsulates to recover the 32-byte shared secret $K_{\\text{PQ}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combine:** The final shared secret is derived by feeding **both** shared\n",
