    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explored **Kyber / ML-KEM**, the NIST-standardized post-quantum KEM. Key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Module-LWE** is the sweet spot between LWE (general but slow) and Ring-LWE (fast but inflexible). Kyber works over $R_q^{k \\times k}$, a matrix of polynomials.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **KEM flow:** KeyGen produces $(\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{t}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{s}+\\mathbf{e})$. Encapsulate creates $(\\mathbf{u}, v)$ encoding a random message. Decapsulate uses $\\mathbf{s}$ to recover the message, and both parties derive the same shared secret $K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Correctness** depends on noise cancellation: $v - \\mathbf{s}^T\\mathbf{u} = \\lceil q/2 \\rfloor \\cdot m + \\text{small noise}$. The $\\mathbf{s}^T\\mathbf{A}^T\\mathbf{r}$ terms cancel algebraically.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **NIST parameters:** ML-KEM-512/768/1024 use $k=2/3/4$ with $n=256$, $q=3329$. Key sizes are ~1 KB (vs 32 bytes for X25519), but performance is competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **This is deployed NOW.** ML-KEM (FIPS 203) protects Chrome, Signal, iMessage, and TLS 1.3 traffic today.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection to the full module:** Notebooks 08a-08c built your lattice intuition (bases, SVP, LLL). Notebook 08d introduced LWE as a hard problem on lattices. Notebook 08e moved to Ring-LWE for efficiency. This notebook (08f) assembled all the pieces into the real-world scheme. The progression was: *geometry* (08a-08c) $\\to$ *hardness* (08d) $\\to$ *efficiency* (08e) $\\to$ *deployment* (08f)."
