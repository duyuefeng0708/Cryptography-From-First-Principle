We even saw that a unimodular transformation $U$ can turn a nice basis into a terrible one while keeping the lattice unchanged.\n",

The best known algorithms would take roughly $2^{250}$ operations — far more than the number of atoms in the observable universe. This hardness is *exactly* what makes post-quantum cryptography possible."

    "The hardness of SVP (and its approximate variant) is the **foundation of lattice-based cryptography**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the key chain of ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SVP is hard in high dimensions.** No known algorithm solves exact SVP in polynomial time. The best algorithms (lattice sieving) run in time $2^{\\Theta(n)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Approximate SVP is also hard.** For polynomial approximation factors $\\gamma = \\text{poly}(n)$, no efficient algorithm is known. Even quantum computers do not help!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LWE reduces to approximate SVP.** The Learning With Errors problem (notebook 08d) has a worst-case to average-case reduction: if you can solve random LWE instances, you can solve approximate SVP on *any* lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Kyber and Dilithium are built on LWE/MLWE.** These NIST post-quantum standards derive their security from the assumed hardness of structured variants of SVP.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Algorithm | Based on | Security relies on |\n",
    "|-----------|----------|--------------------|\n",
    "| **Kyber** (ML-KEM) | Module-LWE | Approximate SVP in module lattices |\n",
    "| **Dilithium** (ML-DSA) | Module-LWE + SIS | Approximate SVP + Short Integer Solution |\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Crypto Foreshadowing:** In the next notebook (08c), we will implement the LLL algorithm, which solves SVP with approximation factor $\\gamma = 2^{n/2}$. This exponential factor is too large to threaten Kyber (which only needs $\\gamma = \\text{poly}(n)$ hardness), but it *is* enough to break some classical lattice schemes. The gap between what LLL achieves and what cryptography needs is precisely where security lives."

With a bad basis, it is hidden and hard to find. |\n| **Successive minima** | $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots$ capture the sequence of shortest linearly independent vectors in the lattice |\n| **Minkowski's theorem** | Upper bound: $\\lambda_1 \\leq \\sqrt{n} \\cdot \\det(L)^{1/n}$. The Gaussian heuristic predicts the typical value. |\n| **Brute-force enumeration** | Works in 2D but is infeasible in high dimensions, where the search space grows as $(2k+1)^n$ |\n| **Approximate SVP** | $\\gamma$-SVP is also believed hard for polynomial $\\gamma$. This is the foundation of Kyber, Dilithium, and all lattice-based post-quantum crypto. |\n\n**Next:** [The LLL Algorithm (08c)](08c-lll-algorithm.ipynb) — a polynomial-time algorithm that approximately solves SVP with factor $\\gamma = 2^{n/2}$."
