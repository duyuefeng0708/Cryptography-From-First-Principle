    "> This is a natural intuition, and it is **not entirely wrong**, structure does reduce the problem's generality, and some structured variants of lattice problems *are* easier. But Ring-LWE specifically has been studied intensively since Lyubashevsky, Peikert, and Regev introduced it in 2010. No known attacks on Ring-LWE exploit the ring structure when parameters are chosen correctly (i.e., $n$ is a power of 2, $q$ is chosen appropriately, and errors are large enough).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The security of Ring-LWE is supported by a **worst-case to average-case reduction**: solving a random Ring-LWE instance is at least as hard as solving the **Shortest Vector Problem (SVP)** on *ideal lattices* in the worst case. This is a weaker assumption than plain LWE's reduction to general lattices, but it is still considered strong enough for cryptographic use."

    "\n",
    "- **The key-size bottleneck:** Plain LWE requires $O(n^2)$ elements for the public matrix. At cryptographic parameters, this means megabytes of key material.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The ring $R_q = \\mathbb{Z}_q[x]/(x^n+1)$:** By working in this polynomial quotient ring (with $n$ a power of 2), we replace the random matrix with a single polynomial. This is the same quotient ring construction from Module 02, applied to the specific cyclotomic polynomial $x^n+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Negacyclic structure:** Multiplying by $a(x)$ in $R_q$ is equivalent to multiplying by a negacyclic matrix. The ring structure constrains the matrix to have this special form, which is why a single polynomial (with $n$ coefficients) determines the entire $n \\times n$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Module-LWE:** The middle ground between LWE and Ring-LWE, used by Kyber/ML-KEM. It uses a small $k \\times k$ matrix of ring elements, balancing efficiency with conservative security.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NTT acceleration:** The Number Theoretic Transform enables $O(n \\log n)$ polynomial multiplication, making Ring-LWE-based schemes competitive with classical cryptography in speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Crypto Foreshadowing:** The NIST standard **ML-KEM** (formerly Kyber, FIPS 203) uses Module-LWE over the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{3329}[x]/(x^{256}+1)$ with module ranks $k \\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$. In the [next notebook](08f-kyber-overview.ipynb), we will see how Ring-LWE becomes a complete key encapsulation mechanism.\n",
