The sigma protocol structure from Module 09 scales from scalars to vectors to polynomials |\n\nThe common thread is the sigma protocol structure from Module 09: **commit, challenge, respond**. What scales up is the complexity of the committed objects (from scalars to vectors to polynomials) and the sophistication of the response (from a single linear equation to inner-product arguments to pairing checks). But the core pattern, and the core commitment scheme, remain the same.\n\n---\n\n*Back to [Module 09: Commitment Schemes and Sigma Protocols](../README.md)*"
