    "A **random oracle** is an idealized hash function with these properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deterministic:** The same input always gives the same output.\n",
    "2. **Uniformly random:** For any *new* input, the output is uniformly random in the output space.\n",
    "3. **Independent:** Knowing $H(x_1), H(x_2), \\ldots$ gives no information about $H(x')$ for any new $x'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the ROM, the hash output $c = H(g, y, R)$ is indistinguishable from a truly random challenge, exactly what the honest verifier would have sent. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The prover cannot predict $c$ before committing to $R$ (since $H$ is \"random\" on new inputs)\n",
    "- The prover cannot find two different $R$ values giving the same $c$ (collision resistance)\n",
    "- The security of the interactive protocol *transfers* to the non-interactive version\n",
    "\n",
    "**In practice**, we use SHA-256 or SHA-3 as the hash function. These are not true random oracles (no real function can be), but they are close enough that Fiat-Shamir-based schemes have been secure for decades."

    "- **Schnorr signatures** are the direct result of applying Fiat-Shamir to the interactive Schnorr protocol with a message included in the hash.\n",
    "- **Security** relies on the **Random Oracle Model**: treating the hash as an ideal random function that prevents the prover from \"cheating\" the challenge.\n",
    "- **Nonce reuse is fatal:** Using the same random $k$ twice leaks the secret key via simple algebra.\n",

    "> **Crypto foreshadowing:** The Fiat-Shamir transform is not limited to Schnorr. It applies to *any* sigma protocol (and more general interactive proofs). This is the engine behind:\n",
    "> - **Ed25519 / EdDSA**, the dominant signature scheme in modern systems (SSH, TLS, crypto wallets)\n",
    "> - **SNARKs** (Module 10), Fiat-Shamir converts interactive SNARK verification into a single non-interactive proof\n",
    "> - **STARKs** (Module 10), built entirely on Fiat-Shamir applied to the FRI protocol\n",
    "> - Every **non-interactive zero-knowledge proof** you'll encounter in practice\n",
