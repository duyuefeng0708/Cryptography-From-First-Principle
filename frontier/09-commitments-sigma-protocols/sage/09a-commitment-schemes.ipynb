    "### Hiding\n",
    "Given a commitment $C$, an adversary cannot determine which message $m$ was committed to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computationally hiding:** No *efficient* algorithm can distinguish commitments to different messages. (The hash commitment achieves this \u2014 as long as the adversary can't invert SHA-256.)\n",
    "- **Perfectly hiding (information-theoretic):** Even with *unlimited* computational power, the adversary learns *nothing* about $m$ from $C$. (The hash commitment does NOT achieve this \u2014 there exists exactly one preimage.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binding\n",
    "The committer cannot find two different messages that produce the same commitment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computationally binding:** No *efficient* algorithm can find $m \\neq m'$ with $\\text{Commit}(m, r) = \\text{Commit}(m', r')$. (The hash commitment achieves this via collision resistance.)\n",
    "- **Perfectly binding (information-theoretic):** It is *impossible* (not just hard) to find a collision. (The hash commitment achieves this! For a fixed $C$, there is at most one valid opening \u2014 well, technically the function is injective on its domain.)\n",

    "## The Fundamental Duality\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a deep and surprising fact:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Theorem (informal):** No commitment scheme can be *both* perfectly hiding *and* perfectly binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** Suppose a scheme is perfectly hiding. Then for every commitment $C$, *every* message $m$ in the message space could have produced $C$ (with some randomness $r$). But that means the committer *can* find an alternative opening \u2014 so the scheme cannot be perfectly binding!\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if a scheme is perfectly binding, then each $C$ has a unique opening, so an unbounded adversary could (in principle) find it \u2014 breaking perfect hiding.\n",

    "\n",
    "The choice depends on your application. For zero-knowledge proofs, we usually want **perfect hiding** (the Pedersen style), because the prover's secret must remain information-theoretically hidden.\n",

They are additively homomorphic \u2014 you can add committed values without opening them.

    "In this notebook we explored **commitment schemes** \u2014 the cryptographic sealed envelope. Key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two phases:** Commit (seal the value), then Reveal (open and verify)\n",
    "- **Two properties:** Hiding (the commitment reveals nothing about the message) and Binding (the committer cannot change the message after committing)\n",
    "- **Hash commitment** $C = H(m \\,\\|\\, r)$: simple, effective, computationally hiding + perfectly binding\n",
    "- **Randomness is essential:** Without $r$, an adversary can brute-force small message spaces and break hiding\n",
    "- **The fundamental duality:** You cannot have *both* perfect hiding and perfect binding \u2014 you must choose one to be computational\n",
    "- **Applications:** Fair coin flipping, sealed-bid auctions, zero-knowledge proofs, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Looking ahead:** In the next notebook, we move from hash-based commitments to **Pedersen commitments** \u2014 an algebraic scheme that achieves *perfect hiding* using the discrete log assumption. Pedersen commitments are *additively homomorphic*: you can add two commitments and get a commitment to the sum, without opening either one. This property is the foundation of Bulletproofs, confidential transactions, and the commitment schemes inside modern zero-knowledge proof systems (SNARKs, STARKs).\n",
