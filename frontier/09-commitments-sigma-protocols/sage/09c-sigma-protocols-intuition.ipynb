Sigma protocols use a very similar idea in their first move: the prover sends a *commitment* to some randomness. The key insight is that this commitment structure, combined with a challenge-response mechanism, can prove knowledge of a secret *without ever revealing it*. The Pedersen commitment you already understand is, in fact, the algebraic engine inside many sigma protocols."

    "2. **Completeness:** An honest prover who knows the witness $x$ always produces a valid proof. We verified this with 1000 successful trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Special soundness:** Two accepting transcripts with the same commitment but different challenges allow extraction of the witness. This guarantees that a prover must actually *know* $x$ to produce valid proofs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Honest-verifier zero-knowledge (HVZK):** A simulator can produce valid-looking transcripts without knowing $x$, meaning the verifier learns *nothing* from the interaction beyond the truth of the statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The simulation argument:** Zero-knowledge means \"the verifier could have generated the transcript themselves.\" If a transcript can be faked, it cannot contain information.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Nonce reuse is catastrophic:** Reusing the random nonce $k$ allows anyone to extract the secret key.\n",
