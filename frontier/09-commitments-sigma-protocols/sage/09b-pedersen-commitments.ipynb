They are computationally hiding -- an efficient adversary can't determine $m$ from $C$. But an adversary with unlimited computing power *could* brute-force every possible $(m', r')$ and find which message was committed. Can we do better?\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Setup:** prime-order group with generators $g$ and $h$ where $\\log_g(h)$ is unknown\n",
    "- **Commitment:** $C = g^m \\cdot h^r$, opened by revealing $(m, r)$\n",
    "- **Perfectly hiding:** for any $C$ and any $m'$, there exists $r'$ with $C = g^{m'} h^{r'}$ -- the commitment leaks zero information, even to an unbounded adversary\n",
    "- **Computationally binding:** finding two valid openings implies solving the DLP\n",
    "- **Hiding-binding duality:** you cannot have both perfect hiding AND perfect binding; Pedersen trades perfect binding for perfect hiding (opposite of hash commitments)\n",
    "- **Homomorphic:** $\\text{Commit}(m_1) \\cdot \\text{Commit}(m_2) = \\text{Commit}(m_1 + m_2)$ -- commitments can be added without opening!\n",
    "- **Vector commitments:** $C = g_1^{m_1} \\cdots g_n^{m_n} \\cdot h^r$ commits to an entire vector\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Crypto foreshadowing:** The homomorphic property of Pedersen commitments is the foundation of **Bulletproofs** range proofs and **confidential transactions** in Monero and Mimblewimble. When you send cryptocurrency in these systems, the transaction amounts are hidden inside Pedersen commitments -- and miners can verify that inputs equal outputs *without seeing any amounts*, using exactly the homomorphic addition we demonstrated above. In [09c](09c-sigma-protocols-intuition.ipynb), we'll see how Pedersen commitments combine with sigma protocols to build zero-knowledge proofs.\n",
