    "In [09b](../sage/09b-pedersen-commitments.ipynb), we learned that Pedersen commitments are **perfectly hiding**: even an all-powerful adversary learns nothing about the committed value from seeing the commitment. We also learned the price: **binding is only computational**, it relies on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what does \"only computational binding\" actually mean in practice? It means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **polynomial-time** adversary cannot find two valid openings for the same commitment (assuming DLP is hard).\n",
    "- A **computationally unbounded** adversary, one who can solve the DLP, **can** open any commitment to any value.\n",

    "2. Open the same commitment to $m' = 99$ (and any other value we choose)\n",
