    "**Motivating Question.** Paillier gives us unlimited additions but no multiplications. How do we get *both*? The **BGV** scheme (Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan, 2011) is built on Ring-LWE and supports both addition and multiplication, but each operation adds noise. The key innovation: **modulus switching** controls this noise by scaling down the ciphertext modulus, trading precision for reduced noise.\n",

    "## 1. The BGV Setup: Polynomial Rings\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Bridge from Notebook 11b.** Paillier and ElGamal work with integers. BGV works with **polynomials**, specifically, polynomials in the ring $R_q = \\mathbb{Z}_q[x]/(x^n+1)$. Why the switch? Two reasons. First, **security**: each polynomial encodes $n$ coefficients, giving us a lattice of dimension $n$, much harder to attack than the 1-dimensional integer LWE from Module 08. This is exactly the Ring-LWE assumption from Notebook 08e. Second, **efficiency**: polynomial multiplication in $R_q$ can be done in $O(n \\log n)$ via NTT/FFT, making operations on $n$ values nearly as fast as on one. The noise encoding $v = m + t \\cdot e$ is analogous to Paillier's $g^m \\cdot r^n$, both hide the message inside an algebraic structure that supports homomorphic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",

    "- $t$: plaintext modulus (messages live in $R_t = \\mathbb{Z}_t[x]/(x^n+1)$)\n",
    "- $q$: ciphertext modulus (ciphertexts live in $R_q$, with $q \\gg t$)\n",
