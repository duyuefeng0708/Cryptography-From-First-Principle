For a random curve over a 256-bit prime, the embedding degree $k$ is astronomically large, making the pairing target field $\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$ computationally infeasible. How do we find curves where $k$ is small enough to compute with, yet large enough for security? This is the art of **pairing-friendly curve construction**.\n",
