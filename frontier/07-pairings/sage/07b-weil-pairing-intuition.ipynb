    "**Motivating Question.** In Notebook 07a we defined bilinear maps abstractly and used SageMath's `weil_pairing()` as a black box. But where does this map actually come from? The answer involves **divisors**, formal sums of points on curves, and **rational functions**. Understanding divisors gives geometric meaning to the pairing and explains *why* bilinearity holds. We won't prove everything rigorously, but we'll build enough intuition to see the pairing as a natural construction, not magic.\n",
