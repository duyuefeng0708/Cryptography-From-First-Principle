But proof systems need a more structured format, one where every constraint has the same shape. **Rank-1 Constraint Systems (R1CS)** rewrite each multiplication gate as a matrix equation: $(A_i \\cdot s) \\times (B_i \\cdot s) = (C_i \\cdot s)$. How do we transform a circuit into matrices, and what is the \"witness\" vector $s$?\n",
