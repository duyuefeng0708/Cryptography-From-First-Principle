How do we evaluate polynomials \"in the exponent\", hiding the witness inside elliptic curve points while still allowing verification? **Groth16** does this using pairings and a trusted setup, producing a proof that's just 3 curve points (< 200 bytes) no matter how big the circuit.\n",

    "> **Bridge from Notebook 10c.** The QAP check is: does $A(\\tau) \\cdot B(\\tau) - C(\\tau) = H(\\tau) \\cdot Z(\\tau)$ for a secret $\\tau$? Recall from 10c that the Schwartz-Zippel lemma guarantees this check at a *single random point* $\\tau$ catches any cheating prover with overwhelming probability, so we only need one evaluation point. The problem: if the verifier learns $A(\\tau)$ as a field element, the witness leaks. The solution: encode $A(\\tau)$ as a curve point $[A(\\tau)]_1 = A(\\tau) \\cdot G_1$ and use a **pairing** (Module 07) to check the multiplication *without* revealing the scalar:\n",
